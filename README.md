Custom icons for the Bigtreetech TFT35 LCD display. I didnt create them from scratch but found them online designed for the MKS TFT35 and edited each one for this display.  

To install, create a folder on a SD card called 'bmp' turn off the display/printer, plug in the SD card and turn on. It should then flash the icons to the display. The SD card can then be removed.

You can get updated firmware for the TFT35 at their official site:  https://github.com/bigtreetech/BIGTREETECH-TFT35-V1.2
